# Instnce

**Project Title:** Instnce

**Team Members:** Nafees Rawji, Ralph Maamari, Simon Ngo

**Description:** A new tab page which displays contexual information important to the user to increase developer velocity.

**Key Features (Beta):**
1. Display weather </br>
2. Display current time </br>
3. Display Jira Tickets </br>

**Key Features (Final)**
1. Integrate with GitHub to manage pull requests within the new tab page. (Might do a cross Github/Jira Integartion through our server.
2. Have more of a *write* ability with creating JIRA Tickets from the screen. (Maybe even more complex things like Retrospectives can be tackled here -- Will require research before committing to it.)

**Technologies:**
1. ReactJS (Front-End)
2. Redux (State Management)
3. Github API (Data Input)
4. Jira API (Data I/O)
5. DarkSky Weather API (Data Input)
</br>
<b>Top 5 Technical Challenges:</b></br>
1. Learning React (First Time!) </br>
2. Learning Redux (And possibly <i>Flux React</i>) (First Time!)</br>
3. Integerating with apis (First Time!) </br>
4. Integrating a Github and Jira Connection (Will be complicated to control the logic behind the scenes) </br>
5. Making into Chrome extenstion (Not sure how to display onNewTab?)</br>
